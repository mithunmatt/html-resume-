  I am a highly skilled and dedicated software developer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My professional experience includes working as an Assistant Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, where I developed expertise in full-stack and backend development, database management, cloud technologies, and DevOps tools.
  
  I excel in backend development, with proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, and SQL, and have extensive experience in optimizing backend systems for scalability and performance. My work includes designing and maintaining complex systems, debugging critical issues, and ensuring efficient database operations using PL/SQL and Oracle 11g RDBMS. I am also well-versed in front-end technologies like Angular, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, making me a versatile developer capable of handling full-stack responsibilities. </p>
  
  <p>With certifications in Google Cloud (Associate Cloud Engineer) and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, I bring expertise in cloud deployment, infrastructure, and security. I have practical experience with AWS, Jenkins for CI/CD, Bitbucket for version control, and Postman for API testing, enabling me to deliver reliable and efficient software solutions.
  
  My experience in Agile development environments has enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively in team settings, participate in sprint planning, and ensure timely project delivery. I am also adept at creating comprehensive technical documentation, which supports clear communication and seamless knowledge sharing among team members.
  
  <p>I hold C1-level proficiency in English, ensuring excellent communication in both professional and multicultural environments. My technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and commitment to innovation drive me to deliver impactful solutions that meet organizational goals.
